--- Day 5: Cafeteria ---
------------------------

As the forklifts break through the wall, the Elves are delighted to discover that there was a cafeteria on the other side after all.

You can hear a commotion coming from the kitchen. "At this rate, we won't have any time left to put the wreaths up in the dining hall!" Resolute in your quest, you investigate.

"If only we hadn't switched to the new inventory management system right before Christmas!" another Elf exclaims. You ask what's going on.

The Elves in the kitchen explain the situation: because of their complicated new inventory management system, they can't figure out which of their ingredients are맍resh마nd which are맙poiled. When you ask how it works, they give you a copy of their database (your puzzle input).

The database operates on말ngredient IDs. It consists of a list of맍resh ingredient ID ranges, a blank line, and a list of마vailable ingredient IDs. For example:

```
3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18

1
5
8
11
17
32

```

The fresh ID ranges are말nclusive: the range`3-5`맔eans that ingredient IDs`3`,`4`, and`5`마re all맍resh. The ranges can also맖verlap; an ingredient ID is fresh if it is in마nyrange.

The Elves are trying to determine which of the마vailable ingredient IDs마re맍resh. In this example, this is done as follows:

-   Ingredient ID`1`말s spoiled because it does not fall into any range.
-   Ingredient ID`5`말s맍resh막ecause it falls into range`3-5`.
-   Ingredient ID`8`말s spoiled.
-   Ingredient ID`11`말s맍resh막ecause it falls into range`10-14`.
-   Ingredient ID`17`말s맍resh막ecause it falls into range`16-20`마s well as range`12-18`.
-   Ingredient ID`32`말s spoiled.

So, in this example,`3`맖f the available ingredient IDs are fresh.

--- Part Two ---
----------------

The Elves start bringing their spoiled inventory to the trash chute at the back of the kitchen.

So that they can stop bugging you when they get new inventory, the Elves would like to know마ll맖f the IDs that the맍resh ingredient ID ranges맊onsider to be맍resh. An ingredient ID is still considered fresh if it is in any range.

Now, the second section of the database (the available ingredient IDs) is irrelevant. Here are the fresh ingredient ID ranges from the above example:

```
3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18

```

The ingredient IDs that these ranges consider to be fresh are`3`,`4`,`5`,`10`,`11`,`12`,`13`,`14`,`15`,`16`,`17`,`18`,`19`, and`20`. So, in this example, the fresh ingredient ID ranges consider a total of`14`말ngredient IDs to be fresh.
