--- Day 7: Laboratories ---
---------------------------

You thank the cephalopods for the help and exit the trash compactor, finding yourself in the [familiar](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6) [halls](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/4) of a North Pole research wing.

Based on the large sign that says "teleporter hub", they seem to be researching teleportation; you can't help but try it for yourself and step onto the large yellow teleporter pad.

Suddenly, you find yourself in an unfamiliar room! The room has no doors; the only way out is the teleporter. Unfortunately, the teleporter seems to be leaking [magic smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke).

Since this is a teleporter lab, there are lots of spare parts, manuals, and diagnostic equipment lying around. After connecting one of the diagnostic tools, it helpfully displays error code `0H-N0`, which apparently means that there's an issue with one of the tachyon manifolds.

You quickly locate a diagram of the tachyon manifold (your puzzle input). A tachyon beam enters the manifold at the location marked `S`; tachyon beams always move downward. Tachyon beams pass freely through empty space (`.`). However, if a tachyon beam encounters a splitter (`^`), the beam is stopped; instead, a new tachyon beam continues from the immediate left and from the immediate right of the splitter.

For example:

```
.......S.......
...............
.......^.......
...............
......^.^......
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.
...............

```

In this example, the incoming tachyon beam (`|`) extends downward from `S` until it reaches the first splitter:

```
.......S.......
.......|.......
.......^.......
...............
......^.^......
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.
...............

```

At that point, the original beam stops, and two new beams are emitted from the splitter:

```
.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^|......
...............
......^.^......
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.
...............

```

Those beams continue downward until they reach more splitters:

```
.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^|......
......|.|......
......^.^......
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.
...............

```

At this point, the two splitters create a total of only three tachyon beams, since they are both dumping tachyons into the same place between them:

```
.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^|......
......|.|......
.....|^|^|.....
...............
.....^.^.^.....
...............
....^.^...^....
...............
...^.^...^.^...
...............
..^...^.....^..
...............
.^.^.^.^.^...^.
...............

```

This process continues until all of the tachyon beams reach a splitter or exit the manifold:

```
.......S.......
.......|.......
......|^|......
......|.|......
.....|^|^|.....
.....|.|.|.....
....|^|^|^|....
....|.|.|.|....
...|^|^|||^|...
...|.|.|||.|...
..|^|^|||^|^|..
..|.|.|||.|.|..
.|^|||^||.||^|.
.|.|||.||.||.|.
|^|^|^|^|^|||^|
|.|.|.|.|.|||.|

```

To repair the teleporter, you first need to understand the beam-splitting properties of the tachyon manifold. In this example, a tachyon beam is split a total of `21` times.

Analyze your manifold diagram. How many times will the beam be split?--- Day 9: Movie Theater ---
----------------------------

You slide down the [firepole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireman%27s_pole) in the corner of the playground and land in the North Pole base movie theater!

The movie theater has a big tile floor with an interesting pattern. Elves here are redecorating the theater by switching out some of the square tiles in the big grid they form. Some of the tiles are red; the Elves would like to find the largest rectangle that uses red tiles for two of its opposite corners. They even have a list of where the red tiles are located in the grid (your puzzle input).

For example:

```
7,1
11,1
11,7
9,7
9,5
2,5
2,3
7,3

```

Showing red tiles as `#` and other tiles as `.`, the above arrangement of red tiles would look like this:

```
..............
.......#...#..
..............
..#....#......
..............
..#......#....
..............
.........#.#..
..............

```

You can choose any two red tiles as the opposite corners of your rectangle; your goal is to find the largest rectangle possible.

For example, you could make a rectangle (shown as `O`) with an area of `24` between `2,5` and `9,7`:

```
..............
.......#...#..
..............
..#....#......
..............
..OOOOOOOO....
..OOOOOOOO....
..OOOOOOOO.#..
..............

```

Or, you could make a rectangle with area `35` between `7,1` and `11,7`:

```
..............
.......OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..#....OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..#....OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..............

```

You could even make a thin rectangle with an area of only `6` between `7,3` and `2,3`:

```
..............
.......#...#..
..............
..OOOOOO......
..............
..#......#....
..............
.........#.#..
..............

```

Ultimately, the largest rectangle you can make in this example has area `50`. One way to do this is between `2,5` and `11,1`:

```
..............
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..............
.........#.#..
..............

```

Using two red tiles as opposite corners, what is the largest area of any rectangle you can make?




--- Part Two ---
----------------

The Elves just remembered: they can only switch out tiles that are red or green. So, your rectangle can only include red or green tiles.

In your list, every red tile is connected to the red tile before and after it by a straight line of green tiles. The list wraps, so the first red tile is also connected to the last red tile. Tiles that are adjacent in your list will always be on either the same row or the same column.

Using the same example as before, the tiles marked `X` would be green:

```
..............
.......#XXX#..
.......X...X..
..#XXXX#...X..
..X........X..
..#XXXXXX#.X..
.........X.X..
.........#X#..
..............

```

In addition, all of the tiles inside this loop of red and green tiles are also green. So, in this example, these are the green tiles:

```
..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..#XXXX#XXXX..
..XXXXXXXXXX..
..#XXXXXX#XX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............

```

The remaining tiles are never red nor green.

The rectangle you choose still must have red tiles in opposite corners, but any other tiles it includes must now be red or green. This significantly limits your options.

For example, you could make a rectangle out of red and green tiles with an area of `15` between `7,3` and `11,1`:

```
..............
.......OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..#XXXXOOOOO..
..XXXXXXXXXX..
..#XXXXXX#XX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............

```

Or, you could make a thin rectangle with an area of `3` between `9,7` and `9,5`:

```
..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..#XXXX#XXXX..
..XXXXXXXXXX..
..#XXXXXXOXX..
.........OXX..
.........OX#..
..............

```

The largest rectangle you can make in this example using only red and green tiles has area `24`. One way to do this is between `9,5` and `2,3`:

```
..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............

```

Using two red tiles as opposite corners, what is the largest area of any rectangle you can make using only red and green tiles?
